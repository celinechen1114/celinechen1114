👋 **Hello World! I'm Celine Chen (@celinechen1114).**

🎨 **About Me**: I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technology, with a burning passion for UI/UX design. My journey in tech is fueled by a profound interest in enhancing user experiences and interfaces.

📚 **Education**: I'm currently in my 3rd year of studying computer science at the University of British Columbia (UBC), where I'm not only learning about algorithms and data structures but also exploring how technology can create meaningful impacts. (previously bio pre-med student ahah~)


🎶 **Fun Facts**: Music is my first love. I initiated a music club back in high school, aiming to support our local children's hospital and bring joy to senior homes through performances. With 13 years of flute, 17 years of piano under my belt, and participation in Canada's most established youth community marching band, my musical journey has been nothing short of amazing.

🌟 **Impact Projects**: My goal is to dive into projects that leave a lasting positive mark on our community. I believe in the power of technology to drive social change and am always eager to contribute my part.

💼 **Collaborations**: I'm on the lookout for exhilarating projects, especially those designed to enrich university life. If you're working on something that aligns with this mission, I'd love to hear from you!

🎨 **Interests**: Outside of coding, you can find me exploring the realms of graphic design, traveling to unseen places, conquering hiking trails, or crafting engaging content.

📫 **Let's Connect!**: To share ideas or propose collaborations, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or drop me a message on Instagram @celinee.chen.

👩🏻‍💻 **Portfolio**: Discover some of the projects I've passionately worked on at Devpost.

Looking forward to creating amazing experiences together!
